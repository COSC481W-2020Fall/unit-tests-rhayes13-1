## My unit tests

- I was originally assigned with creating a unit test to check chart type. Line chart is currently default.

- We decided a lot of the visual functionalities are somewhat redundant or pointless to test, such as this one, so we are exploring new functionalities that we can create unit tests for.

- I have spent most of my time trying to familiarize myself with unit tests and python. I plan to do more in the future as my current test is more of a "dummy" test.
